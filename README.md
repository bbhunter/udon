# Running udon

**udon** can be used to find domains/subdomains for a given Google Analytics ID. In this example for "UA-33427076":

```json
âžœ  $ udon -silent -json -s UA-33427076 | jq -c
{"domain":"soester-anzeiger.de","source":"site-overview"}
{"domain":"wa.de","source":"site-overview"}
{"domain":"suederlaender-tageblatt.de","source":"site-overview"}
{"domain":"trauer.nrw","source":"site-overview"}
{"domain":"come-on.de","source":"site-overview"}
{"domain":"immobilien.wa.de","source":"spyonweb"}
{"domain":"nrw-jobs.de","source":"spyonweb"}
{"domain":"auto.wa.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"come-on.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"immobilien.wa.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"soester-anzeiger.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"trauer.nrw","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"wa-mediengruppe.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"wa.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"web.archive.org","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"www.come-on.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"www.soester-anzeiger.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"www.wa.de","source":"hackertarget"}
{"domain":"wa.de","source":"osint.sh"}
{"domain":"soester-anzeiger.de","source":"osint.sh"}
{"domain":"come-on.de","source":"osint.sh"}
{"domain":"dispspotegcred.tk","source":"osint.sh"}
{"domain":"conmamanan.tk","source":"osint.sh"}
```

To find UA id's following simple `nuclei` [1] template can be used:

```yaml
id: google-analytics-id

info:
  name: Google Analytics ID Discovery
  author: dhn
  severity: info
  tags: tech

requests:
  - method: GET

    path:
      - "{{BaseURL}}"

    extractors:
      - type: regex
        name: ua-id
        part: body
        regex:
          - "UA-[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)"

    redirects: true
    max-redirects: 5
    stop-at-first-match: true
    matchers-condition: and
    matchers:
      - type: regex
        part: body
        regex:
          - "UA-[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)"

      - type: status
        status:
          - 200
```
